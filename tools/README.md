## Goals
Trying to find the most efficient way to take notes.
Looking for simplcitiy and less clutter while taking notes.
Looking for good formatting for math equations and images.
## Original Path
Origininally used Pandoc to transfer org mode to html.
Used a custom script to embed MathJax from a template and append Pandoc code.
## Current Path
Using exporting functionality straight from Org Mode. Requires a little bit of
fiddling to get get everything right.
