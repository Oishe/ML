* Defining the Cost Function
With our input data $X$ and output data $Y$, we want to predict the best hypothesis function $h(x)$. For this we create a measure of accuracy called the cost function: $J(\theta)$. The cost function can also be reffered to as the error function. We want to minimize the error to come up with an accurate hypothesis. For a simple one variable input and one variable output graph we can have a hypothesis with two coefficients.

The cost function will look at the difference between the output data $y_i$ and the predicted output $\hat{y}_i$. It is squared to preserve the magnitude when added up and averaged for the cost of a given hypothesis. The $\frac{1}{2}$ is there to make the derivate easier. Below is the cost function for the example above:
\begin{align}
J(\theta_0,\theta_1) &= \frac{1}{2m}\sum_{i=1}^m (\hat{y}^i-y^i)^2 \\
                     &= \frac{1}{2m}\sum_{i=1}^m (h_\theta(x^i)-y^i)^2
\end{align}

* Graphing Cost Function 1 variable
For a cost function with two parameters, we will draw the graph focusing on one parameter only $\theta_1$. If we graph $J(\theta_1)$ we'll see how the cost changes as we sweep through some values. The goal is to find the minimum point to minimize our cost/error.

* Graphing Cost Function 2 variables
If we sweep over all the possible combinations of $ \theta_0$ and $ \theta_1$ for $J(\theta_0, \theta_1)$, we get a 3-D plot. We can display this 3-D graph as a 2-D graphing using countour plots (similar to elevation charts). By finding the lowest point of our contour plot we can predict the best hypothesis function.
