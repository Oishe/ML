* What is Machine Learning?
A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.
\begin{align*}
\text{P} &= \text{Performance} \\
\text{T} &= \text{Tasks} \\
\text{E} &= \text{Experiance} \\
&P(T) \propto E
\end{align*}
* Types of Learning
** Supervised Learning
There is a given data set where the correct output is known. It is a matter of finding the relationship between the input and the output.
*** Regression
+ Predicting results with continous output
+ Map input variables to a continous function
*** Classification
+ Predicting results with discrete output
+ Map input variables to discrete categories
** Unsupervised Learning
+ Problems with no idea what the results should look like
+ Derive strucutre from the data by clustering based on relationships among variables in the data
+ No feedback based on the prediction results
